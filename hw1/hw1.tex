\section{Exercise 1.1.5}

\emph{Consider the bet that all three dice will turn up sixes at
  least once in $n$ rolls of three dice. Calculate $f(n)$, the
  probability of at least one triple-six when three dice are rolled
  $n$ times. Determine the smallest value of $n$ necessary for a
  favorable bet that a triple-six will occur when three dice are
  rolled $n$ times. (De Moivre would say it should be about
  $216 \log 2 = 149.7$ and so would answer $150$---see Exercise
  1.2.17. Do you agree with him?)}

\bigskip

On any given roll, the probability of rolling a triple-six is
$1/216$. Then the probability of at least one triple-six in $n$ trials
is $n/216$. Then the smallest value of $n$ necessary for a favorable
bet is $109$ trials, not $150$.

\section{Exercise 1.1.10}

\emph{Another well-known gambling system is the martingale doubling
  system. Suppose that you are betting on red to turn up in
  roulette. Every time you win, bet $1$ dollar next time. Every time
  you lose, double your previous bet. Suppose that you use this system
  until you have won at least $5$ dollars or you have lost more than
  $100$ dollars. Write a program to simulate this and play it a number
  of times and see how you do. In the book \emph{The Newcomes},
  W. M. Thackeray remarks ``You have not played as yet?  Do not do so;
  above all avoid a martingale if you do.'' Was this good advice?}

\bigskip

We wrote a program \textbf{Martingale}\footnote{
  \url{https://github.com/anthonybrice/MATH352/blob/master/hw1/Martingale.hs}}
to simulate the game. Running it for $100000$ iterations found that we
could satisfy the conditions with a $0.94629$ probability. However,
one can clearly see that the conditions are stacked in such a way to
allow this. The betting system favors small gains, so reaching 5
dollars is a fairly trivial task. Conversely winning large amounts is
very difficult since as with any typical gambling game, the odds are
against the player and will become apparent over many repeated
rounds. Thackeray's advice is sound.

\section{Exercise 1.2.6}

\emph{A die is loaded in such a way that the probability of each
  face turning up is proportional to the number of dots on that
  face. (For example, a six is three times as likely as a two.) What
  is the probability of getting an even number in one throw?}

\bigskip

To calculate the probability of an even number in one throw, we must
know the probability of each face. Let $m(\omega_1)$ be the
probability of rolling a $1$. Then
\begin{align*}
  P(\Omega) &= m(\omega_1) + 2m(\omega_1) + 3m(\omega_1) + 4m(\omega_1) +
  5m(\omega_1) + 6m(\omega_1)\\
  1 &= 21m(\omega_1)\\
  m(\omega_1) &= \frac{1}{21}.
\end{align*}
Then the probability of the event of rolling an even face is
\[\frac{2}{21} + \frac{4}{21} + \frac{6}{21} = \frac{12}{21} =
\frac{4}{7}.\]

\section{Exercise 1.2.15*}

\emph{Johnny and Mary are taking a mathematics course. The course has
    only three grades: A, B, and C. The probability that Johnny get a
    B is $.3$. Mary says he's lacking a real sense of proportion. The
    probability that Mary gets a B is $.4$. The probability that
    neither gets an A but at least one gets a B is $.1$. What is the
    probability that at least one gets a B but neither gets a C?}

\bigskip

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    AA & AB & AC \\
    BA & BB & BC \\
    CA & CB & CC \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{The possible configurations of Johnny's and Mary's grades.}
  \label{tab:1.2.15}
\end{table}

\bigskip

We have nine distinct events, as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:1.2.15}. Taking the left grade to be Mary's and the
right to be Johnny's, we know that $P(\textrm{BA}) + P(\textrm{BB}) +
P(\textrm{BC}) = .4$ and $P(\textrm{AB}) + P(\textrm{BB}) +
P(\textrm{CB}) = .3$. We are also given that $P(\textrm{BB}) +
P(\textrm{BC}) + P(\textrm{CB}) = .1$.

Summing the first two equations we have that
$P(\textrm{BA}) + 2P(\textrm{BB}) + P(\textrm{BC}) + P(\textrm{AB}) +
P(\textrm{CB}) = .7$.
Subtracting the latter, we then have
$P(\textrm{BA}) + P(\textrm{BB}) + P(\textrm{AB}) = .6$, which is the
probability that at least one gets a B and neither gets a C.

\section{Exercise 1.2.17*}

\emph{Assume that the probability of a ``success'' on a single
  experiment with $n$ outcomes is $1/n$. Let $m$ be the number of
  experiments necessary to make it a favorable bet that at least one
  success will occur (see Exercise 1.1.15).}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\emph{\alph*})]
  \item \emph{Show that the probability that, in $m$ trials, there are
    no successes is $(1 - 1/n)^m$.}
  \item \emph{(de~Moivre) Show that if $m = n \log 2$ then
    \[
    \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} {\left( 1 - {1 \over n} \right)}^m = {1
    \over 2}.
    \]
    Hint:
    \[
    \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} {\left( 1 - {1 \over n} \right)}^n = e^{-1}.
    \]
    Hence for large $n$ we should choose $m$ to be about $n \log 2$.}
  \item \emph{Would de Moivre have been led to the correct answer for
    de~M\'er\'e's two bets if he had used his approximation?}
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item If the probability of a success on a single experiment with $n$
  outcomes is $1/n$, then the probability of no success is $1 -
  1/n$. Then the probability that there are no successes in $m$ trials
  is ${(1 - 1/n)}^m$.
\item
  \begin{align*}
    \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} {\left( 1 - {1 \over n}\right)}^{n
    \log 2} &= e^{ -\log 2} \\
            &= {1 \over 2}.
  \end{align*}
\item For de~M\'er\'e's first bet, de~Moivre would have guessed $6
  \log 2 \approx 4.1589$ so $5$, which is incorrect. For de~M\'er\'e's
  second bet, de~Moivre would have guessed $36 \log 2 \approx 24.9533$
  so $25$, which is correct.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercise 1.2.18}

\textit{
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\textit{\alph*})]
  \item For events $A_1,\dots, A_n$, prove that
    \[
    P(A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_n) \leq P(A_1) + \dots + P(A_n).
    \]
  \item For events $A$ and $B$, prove that
    \[
    P(A \cap B) \geq P(A) + P(B) - 1.
    \]
  \end{enumerate}
}

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \begin{samepage}
  \item
    \[
    P(A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_n) \leq P(A_1) + \dots + P(A_n).
    \]

    \begin{proof}
      Consider the base case, $n = 1$. Certainly $P(A_1) \leq P(A_1)$.

      Assume the claim is true when $n = k$. Then when $n = k + 1$, we
      have on the left side of our inequality
      $P(A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_{k + 1})$. Let
      $A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_k = K$. We then have on the left
      $P(K \cup A_{k+1})$. By Theorem 1.4, \[ P(K \cup A_{k+1}) = P(K)
      + P(A_{k +1}) - P(K \cap A_{k+1}).\]

      Then by our assumption \[P(K) + P(A_{k+1}) - P(K \cap A_{k+1})
      \leq P(A_1) + \dots + P(A_{k+1}).\]
    \end{proof}
  \end{samepage}

  \begin{samepage}
  \item
    \[P(A \cap B) \geq P(A) + P(B) - 1.\]

    \begin{proof}
      We begin with this statement proved in Theorem 1.4:
      \[P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B).\]
      Through substitution and the fact that $P(A \cup B) \leq 1$, we
      have that
      \[1 \geq P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B).\]
      We simply rearrange our terms and
      \[P(A \cap B) \geq P(A) + P(B) - 1.\]
    \end{proof}
  \end{samepage}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercise 1.2.31}

\textit{A reader of Marilyn vos Savant's column wrote in with the
  following question:}
  \begin{quotation}
    \textit{My dad heard this story on the radio. At Duke University, two
    students had received A's in chemistry all semester. But on the
    night before the final exam, they were partying in another state
    and didn't get back to Duke until it was over. Their excuse to the
    professor was that they had a flat tire, and they asked if they
    could take a make-up test. The professor agreed, wrote out a test
    and sent the two to separate rooms to take it. The first question
    (on one side of the paper) was worth $5$ points, and they answered
    it easily. Then they flipped the paper over and found the second
    question, worth $95$ points: `Which tire was it?' What was the
    probability that both students would say the same thing? My dad
    and I think it's $1$ in $16$. Is that right?}
  \end{quotation}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textit{(\alph*)}]
\item \textit{Is the answer $1/16$?}

\item \textit{The following question was asked of a class of
  students. ``I was driving to school today, and one of my tires
  went flat. Which tire do you think it was?'' The responses were as
  follows: right front, $58\%$, left front, $11\%$, right rear,
  $18\%$, left rear, $13\%$. Suppose that this distribution holds in
  the general population. What is the probability that they will
  give the same answer to the second question?}
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item The answer is not $1/16$. There are $16$ possible
  outcomes, but $4$ of them involve the students picking the same
  tire. Thus the probability that they do so is $1/4$.
\item Assigning natural numbers to each tire, we have that
  our sample space $E = \{(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4)\}$. We can easily
  calculate the probability of each outcome in our sample space:
  \begin{align*}
    m(1,1) &= m(1) \cdot m(1) = .58 \cdot .58 = .3364\\
    m(2,2) &= .11 \cdot .11 = .0121\\
    m(3,3) &= .18 \cdot .18 = .0324\\
    m(4,4) &= .13 \cdot .13 = .0169.
  \end{align*}
  Then the sum of all outcomes in $E$ is the probability that the
  students will pick the same tire. Thus
  \[P(E) = \sum_{\omega \in E} m(\omega) = .3978.\]
\end{enumerate}
