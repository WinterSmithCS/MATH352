\subsection{Problem 4}
\begin{description}
\item \textit{In racquetball, a player continues to serve as long as
    she is winning; a point is scored only when a player is serving
    and wins the volley. The first player to win $21$ points wins the
    game. Assume that you serve first and have a probability $.6$ of
    winning a volley when you serve and probability $.5$ when your
    opponent serves. Estimate, by simulation, the probability that you
    will win a game.}
\end{description}  

To estimate by simulation the probability that we will win the game,
we wrote the program \textbf{Racquetball}\footnote{
  \url{https://github.com/anthonybrice/MATH352/blob/master/hw1/racquetball.c}.}.
At each iteration, the program chooses a random number $m(\omega_i)$
in $(0,1]$. From $m(\omega_i)$, the program calculates if the server
won that volley. If so, the server's score is incremented and she
continues to serve. If not, the other player serves. The game ends
when one player reaches $21$ points and that player is declared the
winner. We ran our program $500000$ times, and found that our
probability of winning was about $0.8263$.

\subsection{Problem 9}
\begin{description}
\item \textit{The \textit{Labouchere system} for roulette is played as
    follows. Write down a list of numbers, usually $1$, $2$, $3$,
    $4$. Bet the sum of the first and last, $1+4 = 5$, on red. If you
    win, delete the first and last numbers from your list. If you
    lose, add the amount that you last bet to the end of your
    list. Then use the new list and bet the sum of the first and last
    numbers (if there is only one number, bet that amount). Continue
    until your list becomes empty. Show that, if this happens, you win
    the sum, $1+2+3+4 = 10$, of your original list. Simulate this
    system and see if you do always stop and, hence, always win. If
    so, why is this not a foolproof gambling system?}
\end{description}

To show that we always win the sum of our list, consider that at any
given moment in the game the sum of the list and our winnings is
always the initial sum of the list. Consider the case when we lose a
round; the debit from our winnings is added to the list. Consider the
case when we win; the credit to our winnings is removed from the
list. Thus we always win the initial sum of the list.

I simulated the system with the program \textbf{Labouchere}\footnote{
  \url{https://github.com/anthonybrice/MATH352/blob/master/hw1/Labouchere.hs}}.
Of course, play always does stop. This is not a foolproof gambling system
because the limit on the sum of the list extends to infinity as play
continues. Thus the player would need a nearly infinite amount of
money to ensure she plays each game until her list is empty.

\subsection{Problem 10}
\begin{description}
\item \textit{Another well-known gambling system is the martingale
    doubling system. Suppose that you are betting on red to turn up in
    roulette. Every time you win, bet $1$ dollar next time. Every time
    you lose, double your previous bet. Suppose that you use this
    system until you have won at least $5$ dollars or you have lost
    more than $100$ dollars. Write a program to simulate this and play
    it a number of times and see how you do. In the book \textrm{The
      Newcomes}, W. M. Thackeray remarks ``You have not played as yet?
    Do not do so; above all avoid a martingale if you do.'' Was this
    good advice?}
