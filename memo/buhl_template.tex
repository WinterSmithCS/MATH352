% What format should I follow?  Your memo should be one single-spaced
% page. You should use 12 point Times or Times New Roman for the body
% text of your memo and Arial or other sans serif font for the
% headings in your memo. Your margins should be 1 inch on all
% sides. Your memo should be written in full block format using
% Word. Full block format means no indention at the beginning of
% paragraphs and left justification. To signal the end of one
% paragraph and the beginning of another, you should leave one blank
% line. Do not use a Word memo template for this assignment

% Daniel Brice made most of this template for me.

{\sffamily\textbf{Background Information}}

I am Anthony Brice, a senior-standing computer science and mathematics
major. I transferred from Ventura College in 2013 half-interested in
mathematics, but after I took Anna Bieszczad's Java courses I knew what
I wanted to make my career. My work style mainly entails getting
distracted every fifteen minutes and trying to get as much work done
as possible in between. I am always interested in undergraduate
research opportunities, but my work schedule and other
responsibilities make committing to anything pretty difficult.

{\sffamily\textbf{Course Goals}}

While I chose to take the course mostly because it's required for both
my majors, I believe this to be one of the most rewarding courses in
either discipline. I expect to leave the class with a much better
understanding of the nature of probability and its applications. My
programming experience will hopefully help me with projects in the
course if I can find a way to fit it in.

{\sffamily\textbf{Career, Life Goals, and I}}

After graduation I plan to continue my career as a software
engineer. Someday I hope to land at a workplace in which employees
are expected to pay attention to the literature and trends in their
field of expertise. I also hope to make some meaningful contribution
to the free software community when I am ready.

In my personal life, my fianc\'{e} and I plan to marry soon and settle
local eventually. In my spare time I enjoy reading, video games, pop
music, and server administration. You can find my streaming music
server at \url{www.compastround.com:4040}, but clicking the link will
leave you disappointed.

I look forward to sharing the following semester and course with all
of you.

Best,\\
Anthony Brice
